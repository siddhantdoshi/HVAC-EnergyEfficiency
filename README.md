# ST-Yau-Physics
Project for YHSA by team Phy-041

This project aims to create a novel controller using reinforcement learning to improve the effiiency of heating systems compared to PID and relay controllers.
Based on the application at hand, one can compare the 3 different systems using our metric to see which best suits their purpose.
